## Introduction

This website is designed as an authors main webiste. It is a place to display their work as well as provide personal
information, contact info, and social media links. The primary purpose is to bring prospective readers to the authors
work, and as a space for current followers of their work to get info on new releases. The author discussed
on this website is fictional though some of the work is taken from my own writing and I have used my own name.

### Design
      - Colour Scheme
      
      Two primary colours have been used for the background of the site. These colours are Skobeloff and Polished Pine, they were chosen by using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). Two colors were used for the text both are varying shades of yellow green. The colours were chosen to fit the aesthetic of the authors work and maintain a fantasy like feeling.

      - Typography
      
      The primary font that has been used across the website is Libre Calson Tect, Serif has been used as a back up font in case the primary font fails to load. This font was chosen because it maintains an aesthetic matching the authors style while being clean and easy to read.

      - Imagery
      
      The images used are all reflections of the authors work. Three images have been used across the website. Two of them are book covers, these are important in drawing prospective readers attentions to the authors work. There is also an image of the author which has been used to fill space and catch the users attention.

#### Issues

To resolve an issue with text overlapping images and pixelation/distortion of images on some 
medium to smaller screen sizes I set the width of images to 100%. This works well on samller
all screen sizes in terms of the position of content across all pages. However, on some large
screen sizes this creates some large images and empty spaces. The images are still clear and
not distorted. This was deemed acceptable as it is a mobile first approach and fits nicely
with the design and layout on smaller devices without causing any issues that aren't aesthetic on
larger device screens. 


### Version Control

#### Git & GitHub

I used GitPod as an IDE and Github as a remote reposiory.

- To start with I created a respository on GitHub using Code Institutes
template.
- I then opened the repository in GitPod where I wrote my code.
- The code written in GitPod was pushed to GitHub.

### Deployment

I deployed the website on GitHub pages using the following steps:

   1. Go to "Settings" in your respository.
   2. Select "Pages" from the left hand menu.
   3. Select the branch and folder then save.
   4. The website is now running on GitHub pages.
