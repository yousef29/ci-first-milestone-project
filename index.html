                        Oakheart follows the story of Melduo as he leaves home and joins an order of druids steeped in awe and mystery.
                        This was my favorite book of the year by far. Oakheart was impossible to put down.

                    <h2>Excerpt from chapter 1</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A week after leaving Delwood Hill, Melduro had travelled further from his home than ever before. It was a chill spring morning,
                        the sun glinting through the dew creating a golden halo across the land. As Melduro crested a hill he saw the stone spires of the
                        Crowned Hill rising above the horizon. He stopped dead in his tracks, in awe. It was the first time Melduro had ever seen the 
                        Crowned Hill; he had of course heard descriptions of the hill, but they had done little to prepare him for the sight that lay before him.
                        The hill rose up like a stony fist, with five spires reaching into the sky. It was these spires that gave the hill its name. Having overcome
                        his initial shock, Melduro hefted his backpack and continued his journey hurrying along the road with a renewed vigour. If he kept up the pace,
                        he would reach the base of the hill by mid-afternoon. As he got closer, he could see a groove carved into the side of the hill spiralling
                        up and round, running from the base up to the top. The top of the hill looked unnaturally flat, apart from the five spires jutting out in a circle
                        around the edge of the hill. Crooked trees had somehow managed to find a home amongst the rocky hillside. A lone tree stood atop the hill
                        surrounded by the stone spires. The tree rose up, dominating the skyline. Melduro had never seen a Heartree before but he knew that was 
                        what he saw before him. Heartrees were sacred trees to the Druids, forming the centre of their halls. At the foot of the hill,
                        Melduro could see a small settlement, a few thatched roofs, smoke lazily wafting from stone chimneys. The area around the Crowned Hill was flat
                        and grassy - good land for farming and an altogether rare site in the Ostian Hinterlands, a region dominated by hills and rocky outcrops.
                        This area was called the Bowl of the Druids, flat and stretching out from the base of the hill for half a mile before the land gently sloped
                        upwards for another mile and melded back into the rise and fall of hills and boulders that was so familiar in the Hinterlands. Melduro could
                        see farms and homesteads scattered across the Bowl of the Druids, more heavily concentrated in the flat land and decreasing in numbers the higher
                        up the slope his eyes travelled. There were only two settlements though; one at the foot of the hill, which, from where Melduro stood,
                        looked no bigger than five or six homes and a large hall and a second settlement closer to the peak of the slope. This second settlement however,
                        had a far more impressive look. He did not have a clear view of the town as it lay on the other side of the Crowned Hill, but from what he could
                        see it was unlike any settlement he had seen in the Hinterlands before.
